Blueribbon was a startup I was trying to build late 2019, as a platform for business to sell products and services as subscriptions. 
This repository is the business facing dashboard, where an onboarded business could:

- Set their product catalog
- Select delivery areas
- Select subscription timeframes for different products
- Create links to share on social media
- Monitor orders placed via the app
- View invoices (via Stripe)

(These are features that I built in a 3-4 month period)

Built using React, Javascript & a little Typescript
